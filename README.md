# AUTOMATIC-PLANT-WATERING-SYSTEM
This project is a cost-effective, Arduino-based solution designed to automate the watering of plants using real-time soil moisture data. It ensures plants are watered only when needed, preventing both overwatering and underwatering — key factors for maintaining healthy plants, especially when users are busy or away.
🎯 Objectives

    Automatically detect soil moisture levels and activate watering when below a defined threshold.

    Conserve water by reducing unnecessary watering.

    Provide a consistent and reliable method of plant care.

    Create a DIY-friendly system using common components like Arduino Uno, Soil Moisture Sensor, Relay Module, and a Water Pump.

🧰 Components Used

    Arduino Uno

    Soil Moisture Sensor (analog)

    12V Water Pump

    5V Relay Module

    Tubing and Water Reservoir

    Jumper Wires and Breadboard

    External Power Supply

🧪 Working Principle

    The Soil Moisture Sensor reads the current soil condition.

    If the soil is drier than a predefined threshold, the Arduino triggers the Relay Module, turning on the Water Pump.

    Water is delivered to the plant, and the pump turns off once the soil reaches a healthy moisture level.

    The system operates autonomously based on sensor feedback.

✅ Key Features

    Fully automated plant watering

    Reduces human error in plant care

    Promotes water conservation

    Simple calibration for different plants

    Easy to assemble and modify

⚠️ Limitations

    Dependent on power supply and pump capacity

    May require tuning for different soil/plant types

    Basic version lacks remote monitoring (can be extended with IoT features)

🔚 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how embedded systems and basic electronics can be applied to solve everyday problems like plant maintenance. It lays a strong foundation for more advanced smart gardening systems involving IoT or mobile apps.
